# Superheader
The Super Header offers a high impact ad size using the full width of the website. The Superheader is the perfect choice when impact and awareness is important due to it being positioned at the top of the page and being cross browser.

To upload the creative within Pexi you need a Pexi account and access to the correct advertiser. You can request a Pexi account via traffic@pexi.nl. When you have access to Pexi you can upload the banner as a zip (zip the folder, not the files). If you include the IAB size within the filename Pexi will automatically detect and adjust the upload settings.
